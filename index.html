    <h1>All you need to know about Croissants:</h1>
    <p>Croissants are buttery, flaky pastries originating from Austria but perfected in France. Made from layered dough
        and
        butter, they’re baked to golden perfection with a light, airy texture inside. These crescent-shaped treats are
        often
        enjoyed for breakfast or as a snack, plain or filled with chocolate, ham, or cheese. The process of making
        croissants
        involves careful lamination to create their signature layers. They’re a symbol of French culinary artistry and
        loved
        worldwide! 🥐</p>
